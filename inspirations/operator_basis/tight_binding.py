        Returns a composite tight binding operator as a matrix.

        Args:
            name_sequence (str): A string of tight binding operator names, one per site.
                Allowed characters are:

                - "X": identity operator on the site
                
                - "L": hopping to the left (from site i to site i-1)
                
                - "R": hopping to the right (from site i to site i+1)
                
                - "N": number operator on the site

                The string must have length equal to the number of sites, and contain at most one non-"X" character.

                Examples:
                
                (1) "XXLXX": :math:`| 2\rangle\langle 3 |`, the particle on the third site hops to the left.
                
                (2) "XXRXX": :math:`| 4\rangle\langle 3 |`, the particle on the third site hops to the right.
                
                (3) "XXNXX": :math:`| 3\rangle\langle 3 |`, number operator for the third site.
                
                (4) "XXXXX": Identity operator for all sites (sum of projectors onto each site).

        Returns:
            torch.Tensor: The operator matrix of shape (n_sites, n_sites).
